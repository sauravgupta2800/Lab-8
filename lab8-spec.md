# Lab 8 - BSTs, BFS, and DFS

## Description

- Practice implementing a slightly bigger data structure
- Working with FILO vs. FIFO procedures

## Part A) Binary Search Tree: definition and opertions (3 points)

Finish implementing the following metohds inside of `a_bst.py`:

* `initialize()`
* `isEmpty()`
* `inorder_traversal()`
* `postorder_traversal()`
* `search()`
* `insert()`
* `remove()`

## Part B) BFS (2 points)

Fill out lines `31, 39` in file `b_bfs.py` to properly display BFS order when you run the file.

Hint: `0, -2, 1, -10, 10, -5, 5`


## Part C) DFS (2 points)

Fill out lines `31, 39` in file `c_dfs.py` to properly display DFS order when you run the file.

Hint: `0, -2, -10, -5, 1, 10, 5`


## Submission

Push your work to GitHub (3 points), and have your code checked off in lab.
